## Setup

Setup Reddit authorised applications. This projects makes use of an 'web app' application for reading other users accounts (Set 'redirect uri' as https://example.com/accounts/reddit/login/callback/). 

It also uses a separate 'personal use script' for an individual account that will be responsible for setting the flairs on the target subreddit. 
Ensure that account has subreddot permissions to set flairs on the target subreddit (moderator permissions). 


You can make apps on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) for a logged in account.

* Copy template.env to .env and set the environment variables:
    * `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` should be a strong, secure [secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#secret-key) for Django.
    * `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` Reddit Script Credentials.
    * `REDDIT_SECRET` Reddit Script Credentials.
    * `REDDIT_USERNAME` Reddit Script Credentials.
    * `REDDIT_USER_PASSWORD` Reddit Script Credentials.
    * `SUBREDDIT_NAME_TO_ACT_ON` The subreddit that the project will edit flairs on.
    * `WEBSITE_REDDIT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` OAuth Web App Credentials.
    * `WEBSITE_REDDIT_OAUTH_SECRET` OAuth Web App Credentials.
    * `DEBUG` Sets the website in debug mode or not. Unset to disable.
    * `USE_HTTPS` Controls whether the site is hosted via HTTPS. Uses HTTPS for OAuth redirect URIs and enables additional security settings. Unset to disable.
    * `ALLOWED_HOSTS` If `DEBUG` is not set, a list of hostnames where the application should be accessible, separated by semicolons. In debug mode, this setting is ignored and all hosts are allowed.

* Create the website's database: `python manage.py migrate`.
* Create a superuser for the website: `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
* Run the server with: `manage.py runserver`
* Connect to admin interface server at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
* Add your host/domain name(s) to `Sites` on the admin page (`.../admin/sites/site/`).
* Configure a Social application on the admin page (`.../admin/socialaccount/socialapp/`) for Reddit. Get that URI right http/https matters.
* Start setting up flairs in the website's database:
  * [Setup emoji on your subreddit.](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010560371-Emojis)
  * [Setup flair templates on your subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010541651-User-Flair)
  * Additional flair images can be added to the website in `flair/static/flairs`.
  * Use the admin page to setup a `Flair type` you will use your setup emoji and template from the above two steps. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/XAvboSA.png)
  * Set up a `Flair type` with an `award` `Flair Type` and then award that flair in `Flairs awardeds`, note the reddit username is case-sensitive.
* Go to the flair site and login as a reddit user, test the set (`.../flair/set`) and wiki pages (`.../wiki`)
* You should now be able to see the loaded flairs and set them.
